FFmpeg Source Code Offer
========================

This product includes FFmpeg binaries that are licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later.
In compliance with GPLv2 Section 3(b), BurntToasters offers to provide the
complete corresponding source code for the exact FFmpeg binaries (and all
statically linked components) that are distributed with CONV2. This includes
the build scripts and configuration used to produce those binaries.

This offer is valid for at least three years from the date you received the
binaries. We will provide the source code on a physical medium or electronically,
for a charge no more than the cost of physically performing distribution.

To request the source code, contact:
BurntToasters <code@rosie.run>
